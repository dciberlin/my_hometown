          <p>
            São Paulo is the third largest city in the world and home to 20 million fiercely proud paulistanos (as residents are known), all of whom will happily tell you at length to you how they'd never live elsewhere. Spend time with them and the reasons will soon unfold. Maybe they will introduce you to the city’s innumerable art-house cinemas and experimental theaters. If they’re gourmands, they’ll focus on the smart bistros and gourmet restaurants that make the city a world-renowned foodie haven. If they’re scenesters, follow them on a raucous tour of underground bars and the 24/7 clubbing scene. Whatever pleasures you might covet, Sampa (the city's affectionate nickname) probably has them in spades. <br>
            The city has the largest GDP in South America, and also in the Southern Hemisphere, making it a natural cultural, economic and political capital of the south - both nationally and internationally. Below are additional things you need to know as you make your plans to pay pilgrimage to this great city.

              <p>São Paulo, Brazil is the largest city in Latin America, edging out runner-up Mexico City by a couple of million inhabitants. It has a long and interesting history, including serving as home base for the infamous Bandeirantes.<br><br>
                  <strong>Foundation</strong><br>
                    The first European settler in the area was João Ramalho, a Portuguese sailor who had been shipwrecked. He was the first to explore the area of present-day São Paulo. Like many cities in Brazil, São Paulo was founded by Jesuit Missionaries. São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was established in 1554 as a mission to convert Guainás natives to Catholicism. In 1556-1557 the Jesuits built the first school in the region. The town was strategically located, being between the ocean and fertile lands to the west, and it is also on the Tietê River. It became an official city in 1711.                    <br><br><strong>Bandeirantes</strong><br>
                    In the early years of São Paulo, it became the home base for the Bandeirantes, which were explorers, slavers, and prospectors who explored the interior of Brazil.</p>
