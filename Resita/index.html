            <p>Reșița (Romanian pronunciation: [ˈreʃit͡sa]; German: Reschitz; Hungarian: Resicabánya; Croatian: Ričica;
                Czech: Rešice; Serbian: Решица/Rešica; Turkish: Reşçe) is a city in western Romania and the capital of
                Caraș-Severin County, in the Banat region. Its 2011 population was 73,282.The name of Reșița might come
                from the Latin recitia, meaning "cold spring", as the historian Nicolae Iorga once suggested, presuming
                that the Romans gave this name to Resita,from a water spring on the Doman valley.</p>

            <p>This lake and the surroundings represent a great place to relax for a weekend and to enjoy green forest.
                You may have also short trips or you may go boating on the lake. Using tents is also recommended, since
                there are many places to camp.</p>

            <p>Having its source in the Semenic Mountains, the Bârzava River slowly flows downhill only to rest for a
                while between the shores of the Gozna Lake, also know as Văliug Lake by the locals. The name of Văliug
                comes from the neighboring village.</p>

            <p>The landscape is unique, the emerald colored waters reflect the bordering, guardian, trees in its luster.
            </p>

            <p>As one of the highlights of the Banat Mountain, the summer is full of tourists. The lake is arranged as
                to allow swimming or boating (without engine). Tourists are not lacking in winter either as they are
                being attracted by the nearby slope.</p>

            <p>Văliug dam was built in 1909 to produce electricity and water. It has an area of 12.6 ha and a maximum
                depth of 25 m.</p>

            <p>In 2012 the lake was drained for carrying out maintenance work on the dam. The lake was refilled
                naturally in 2013.</p>

            <p>The resort is located on the Semenic Mountain, which is a part of the Banat Mountains in Caraş-Severin
                County. Semenic is situated on top of Mount Semenic at an altitude of 1,400m, about 36 km away from the
                county capital, Reşiţa. It is a fact that on Mount Semenic, in comparison with the other ski resorts of
                Romania, the snow gets the thickest throughout the year, frequently reaching a layer thickness above 2
                m, that stretches the ski season up to the end of April, and sometimes even May.</p>

            <p>Imagine a lake with water so clear, you can see the fish swimming. Or one that looks like it's take from
                a fairy tale. Such a lake exists in Romania, and is called Ochiul Beiului (translated as the Bey's Eye).
            </p>

            <p>It is one of Romania’s most beautiful lakes, surrounded by a green forest, in a wild area of
                Caras-Severin county, in South - Western Romania. The lake is located in the Cheile Nerei -Beusnita
                Natural Park, and is one of the main tourist attraction of the area.</p>

            <p>The most interesting thing about the 3.6-meter deep lake is that its water doesn’t freeze even at
                extremely low temperatures during winter, because of the spring that permanently feeds the lake with
                water. The lake’s water has a special blue-green color- so clear that you can see the fish swimming.</p>

            <p>This lake that looks like it’s been taken out of a fairytale also inspired several legends. One of them
                is a love story that ended tragically. The legend says that the son of a famous bey (name for Turkish
                leader) in the area fell in love with a shepherd’s daughter. The bey didn’t agree with their love, so he
                decided to kill the young girl. Full of sadness and sorrow, the bey’s son shed so many tears that he
                filled this lake that today bears his name and has the color of his eyes. Overwhelmed by pain and fury,
                the young boy also decided to take his life.</p>

            <p>It is also said that the bey’s son has turned into the Ochiul Beiului lake, and the young girl turned
                into Beusnita river.</p>

            <p>Another legend says that on the night of Sanziene – the midsummer celebration in Romania, fairies gather
                around the lake, dancing and bathing. They also bewitch men with their charm.</p>

            <p>The only way you can access this lake is by foot, through the forest.</p>
