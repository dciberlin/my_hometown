    <h1>Venezuelan Crisis</h1>
    <p class="crisis">A socioeconomic and political crisis that began in Venezuela during the presidency of Hugo Chávez, has continued into the presidency of Nicolás Maduro. It is marked by hyperinflation, climbing hunger, disease, crime and death rates, and massive emigration from the country.[3] The situation is the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history, and among the worst in the world since 2014.

            On 2 June 2010, Chávez declared an "economic war" because of the increasing shortages in Venezuela. The crisis intensified under the Maduro government, growing more severe as a result of low oil prices in early 2015,[6] and a drop in Venezuela's oil production from lack of maintenance and investment.[3] The government failed to cut spending in the face of falling oil revenues, and has dealt with the crisis by denying it exists[7] and violently repressing opposition. Political corruption, chronic shortages of food and medicine, closure of companies, unemployment, deterioration of productivity, authoritarianism, human rights violations, gross economic mismanagement and high dependence on oil have also contributed to the worsening crisis.The contraction of national and per capita GDPs in Venezuela from 2013–17 was more severe than that of the United States during the Great Depression, or of Russia, Cuba, and Albania following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Estimated to drop by 25% in 2019, the IMF said the contraction in Venezuela's GDP—the largest since the Libyan Civil War began in 2014—was affecting all of Latin America. The annual inflation rate for consumer prices has risen hundreds and thousands of percentage points, while the economy contracted by nearly 20% in 2016. At the end of 2018, inflation had reached 1.35 million percent.
            
            Supporters of the government say that the problems result from an "economic war" on Venezuela[13] and "falling oil prices, international sanctions, and the country's business elite"; critics of the government say the cause is "years of economic mismanagement, and corruption". In 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented that "information gathered indicates that the socioeconomic crisis had been unfolding for several years prior to the imposition of these sanctions";[16] Michelle Bachelet updated the situation in a 20 March oral report following the visit of a five-person delegation to Venezuela, saying that the social and economic crisis was dramatically deteriorating, the government had not acknowledged or addressed the extent of the crisis, and she was concerned that although the "pervasive and devastating economic and social crisis began before the imposition of the first economic sanctions", the sanctions could worsen the situation. The New York Times says the Maduro administration was "responsible for grossly mismanaging the economy and plunging the country into a deep humanitarian crisis in which many people lack food and medical care".National and international analysts and economists have argued that the crisis is not the result of a conflict or natural disaster but the consequences of populist policies that began under the Chávez administration's Bolivarian Revolution; the Brookings Institution asserted that "Venezuela has really become the poster child for how the combination of corruption, economic mismanagement, and undemocratic governance can lead to widespread suffering."
            
            The crisis has affected the life of the average Venezuelan on all levels. By 2017, hunger had escalated to the point where almost three-fourths of the population had lost an average of over 8 kg (over 19 lbs) in weight,[a] and more than half did not have enough income to meet their basic food needs. Reuters reported that a UN report estimated in March 2019 that 94% of Venezuelans live in poverty, and more than 1/10th of Venezuelans (3.4 million) have left their country.[23] The UN analysis estimates in 2019 that one quarter of Venezuelans need some form of humanitarian assistance.[23][24] Venezuela led the world in murder rates, with 81.4 per 100,000 people killed in 2018, making it the third most violent country in the world.
