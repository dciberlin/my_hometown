        Al-Hasakah (Arabic: الحسكة‎, Kurdish: Hesîçe‎, Syriac: ܚܣܟܗ‎, romanized: Ḥasake) also known as Al-Hasakeh,
        Al-Hasaka or simply Hasakah, is the capital city of the Al-Hasakah Governorate and it is located in the far
        northeastern corner of Syria.[1] With a population of 188,160 residents in 2004, Al-Hasakah is among the ten
        largest cities in Syria and the largest in the governorate. It is the administrative center of a nahiyah
        ("subdistrict") consisting of 108 localities with a combined population of 251,570 in 2004.[2]

        Al-Hasakah has an ethnically diverse population of Kurds, Arabs and Assyrians and a smaller number of
        Armenians.[3][4] The Khabur River runs through Al-Hasakah and the rest of the governorate.

        Al-Hasakah is 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of the Turkish border-city of Qamishli. The Khabur River, a
        tributary of the Euphrates River flows through the city, downriver from Ras al-Ayn, another border town. The
        Jaghjagh River flows into the Khabur River at Al-Hasakah..In the city centre, an ancient tell is identified by
        Dominique Charpin as the location of the city of Qirdahat.[5] Another possibility is that it was the site of the
        ancient Aramean city of Magarisu, mentioned by the Assyrian king Ashur-bel-kala who fought the Arameans near the
        city.[6] The etymology of Magarisu is Aramaic (from the root mgrys) and means "pasture land".[7] The city was
        the capital of the Aramean state of Bit-Yahiri invaded by Assyrian kings Tukulti-Ninurta II and Ashurnasirpal
        II.

        Excavations in the tell discovered materials dating to the Middle-Assyrian, Byzantine and Islamic eras. The last
        level of occupation ended in the fifteenth century.[9] A period of 1,500 years separated between the
        Middle-Assyrian level and the Byzantine level.[10]

        In Ottoman times the town was insignificant. Today's settlement was established in April 1922 by a French
        military post. After the expulsion and genocide of the Armenians in the then Ottoman Empire many refugees fled
        to the city and began to develop it in the 1920s.

        During the French mandate period, Assyrians, fleeing ethnic cleansings in Iraq during the Simele massacre,
        established numerous villages along the Khabur River during the 1930s. French troops were stationed on the
        Citadel Hill during that time. In 1942 there were 7,835 inhabitants in al-Hasakah, several schools, two churches
        and a gas station. The new city grew from the 1950s to the administrative center of the region. The economic
        boom of the cities of Qamishli and al-Hasakah was a result of the irrigation projects started in the 1960s which
        transformed Northeast Syria into the main cotton-growing area. The 1970s brought oil production from the oil
        fields of Qara Shuk and Rumaylan in the extreme northeast.On 26 January 2011, in one of the first events of the
        uprising,[11] Hasan Ali Akleh from Al-Hasakah poured gasoline on himself and set himself on fire, in the same
        way Tunisian Mohamed Bouazizi had in Tunis on 17 December 2010. According to eyewitnesses, the action was "a
        protest against the Syrian government".[12][13][better source needed] In 2012, Al-Hasakah, which has a large
        Kurdish population, began witnessing protests of several thousand people against the Syrian government. From
        2013, the militia associated with the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the People's Protection Units (YPG),
        controlled Kurdish districts and government Arab districts. There were also clashes in the city between an Arab
        insurgent group and the YPG.[citation needed]

        In the Battle of Hasakah during summer 2015, the Syrian Government lost large areas of control of the city to
        Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) which were then captured by the People's Protection Units (YPG).
        Afterwards, some 75% of Hasakah and all surrounding countryside were under the administration of the Federation
        of Northern Syria – Rojava, while only some inner city quarters were controlled by the Syrian
        Government.[14][15][16] On 1 August 2016 the Syrian Democratic Council opened a public office in Al-Hasakah.[17]

        On 16 A, the Battle of al-Hasakah (2016) started, with YPG and Asayish capturing most of the remaining areas
        held by government forces.[18] On 23 August 2016 an agreement between the YPG and the Syrian Army resulted in
        ceasefire within Al-Hasakah.[19][20] Al-Hasakah since is self-administered within Jazira Canton in the framework
        of the de facto autonomous Federation of Northern Syria Rojava.
