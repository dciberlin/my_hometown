            <h2>Damscus</h2>
            <p>
                Damascus (/dəˈmæskəs/; Arabic: دمشق‎, translit. Dimašq [diˈmaʃq], Syrian Arabic: [dɪˈmaʃʔ]) is the
                capital of the Syrian Arab Republic; it is also the country's largest city, following the decline in
                population of Aleppo due to the battle for the city. It is colloquially known in Syria as aš-Šām (الشام)
                and titled the "City of Jasmine" (مدينة الياسمين Madīnat al-Yāsmīn). In addition to being one of the
                oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,[5] Damascus is a major cultural center of the Levant
                and the Arab world. The city has an estimated population of 1,711,000 as of 2009.[3]
                Located in south-western Syria, Damascus is the center of a large metropolitan area of 2.7 million
                people (2004).[6] Geographically embedded on the eastern foothills of the Anti-Lebanon mountain range 80
                kilometres (50 mi) inland from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean on a plateau 680 metres (2,230 ft)
                above sea level, Damascus experiences a semi-arid climate because of the rain shadow effect. The Barada
                River flows through Damascus.
                First settled in the second millennium BC, it was chosen as the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate from
                661 to 750. After the victory of the Abbasid dynasty, the seat of Islamic power was moved to Baghdad.
                Damascus saw a political decline throughout the Abbasid era, only to regain significant importance in
                the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods. Today, it is the seat of the central government and all of the
                government ministries. As of 2018, Damascus has witnessed repeated conflicts and has been considered by
                Mercer as one of the most unfavorable places to live.[7]

            <h2>Damscus</h2>
            <p>
                The name of Damascus first appeared in the geographical list of Thutmose III as
                T-m-ś-q in the 15th century BC.[8] The etymology of the ancient name "T-m-ś-q" is uncertain. It is
                attested as 𒀲𒋙 Imerišú in Akkadian, T-m-ś-q in Egyptian, Dammaśq (דמשק) in Old Aramaic and
                Dammeśeq (דמשק) in Biblical Hebrew. A number of Akkadian spellings are found in the Amarna letters, from
                the 14th century BC: Dimasqa, Dimàsqì, and Dimàsqa. Later Aramaic spellings of
                the name often include an intrusive resh (letter r), perhaps influenced by the root dr, meaning
                "dwelling". Thus, the English and Latin name of the city is "Damascus" which was imported from (Greek:
                Δαμασκός) originated from "the Qumranic Darmeśeq (דרמשק), and Darmsûq in Syriac[9][10]",
                meaning "a well-watered land".[11] In Arabic, the city is called Dimašqu š-Šāmi (دمشق الشام), although
                this is often shortened to either Dimašq or aš-Šām by the citizens of Damascus, of Syria and other Arab
                neighbors and Turkey (as Şam). Aš-Šām is an Arabic term for "Levant" and for "Syria"; the latter, and
                particularly the historical region of Syria, is called Bilādu š-Šāmi (بلاد الشام / "land of the
                Levant"). Historically, Baalshamin or Ba'al Šamem (Aramaic:translit. Lord of
                Heaven(s)),[12][13] was a Semitic sky-god in Canaan/Phoenicia and ancient Palmyra.[14][15] Hence, Sham
                refers to (heaven or sky).

            <h2>Damscus</h2>
            <p>
                Damascus was built in a strategic site on a plateau 680 m (2,230 ft) above sea level and about 80 km (50
                mi) inland from the Mediterranean, sheltered by the Anti-Lebanon mountains, supplied with water by the
                Barada River, and at a crossroads between trade routes: the north-south route connecting Egypt with Asia
                Minor, and the east-west cross-desert route connecting Lebanon with the Euphrates river valley. The
                Anti-Lebanon mountains mark the border between Syria and Lebanon. The range has peaks of over 10,000 ft.
                and blocks precipitation from the Mediterranean sea, so that the region of Damascus is sometimes subject
                to droughts. However, in ancient times this was mitigated by the Barada River, which originates from
                mountain streams fed by melting snow. Damascus is surrounded by the Ghouta, irrigated farmland where
                many vegetables, cereals and fruits have been farmed since ancient times. Maps of Roman Syria indicate
                that the Barada river emptied into a lake of some size east of Damascus. Today it is called Bahira
                Atayba, the hesitant lake, because in years of severe drought it does not even exist.[16]

            <h2>Damscus</h2>

            <p>
                The old city of Damascus, enclosed by the city walls, lies on the south bank of the river Barada which
                is almost dry (3 cm (1 in) left). To the south-east, north and north-east it is surrounded by suburban
                areas whose history stretches back to the Middle Ages: Midan in the south-west, Sarouja and Imara in the
                north and north-west. These neighborhoods originally arose on roads leading out of the city, near the
                tombs of religious figures. In the 19th century outlying villages developed on the slopes of Jabal
                Qasioun, overlooking the city, already the site of the al-Salihiyah neighborhood centered on the
                important shrine of medieval Andalusian Sheikh and philosopher Ibn Arabi. These new neighborhoods were
                initially settled by Kurdish soldiery and Muslim refugees from the European regions of the Ottoman
                Empire which had fallen under Christian rule. Thus they were known as al-Akrad (the Kurds) and
                al-Muhajirin (the migrants). They lay 2–3 km (1–2 mi) north of the old city.
