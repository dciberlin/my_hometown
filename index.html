    <p>
        Founded in the 3rd millennium B.C., Damascus was an important cultural and commercial centre, by virtue of its
        geographical position at the crossroads of the orient and the occident, between Africa and Asia. The old city of
        Damascus is considered to be among the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world. Excavations at Tell
        Ramad on the outskirts of the city have demonstrated that Damascus was inhabited as early as 8,000 to 10,000 BC.
        However, it is not documented as an important city until the arrival of the Aramaeans. In the Medieval
        period, it was the centre of a flourishing craft industry, with different areas of the city specializing in
        particular trades or crafts.
